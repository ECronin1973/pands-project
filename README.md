Analysis of Fisher's Iris Dataset

Introduction
Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, as an example of *linear discriminant analysis* i.e. a method used in statistics to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. 
In this study, Fisher wished to investigate if the species of an Iris flower could be identified by examining its petal and sepal length and width.
